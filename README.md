This level requires commitment and putting high amount of work and effort into this course.
If you ever get stuck in solving a problem for more than 20 min seek help. Also it is a common practice to share your solution for a specific problem but you should not give it in detail. It is also okay to use code from other resources but you have to acknowledge that. READING, READING, READING is key to success. Documentation is essintial and something you have to practice in order to be able to communicate your solutions and ideas within a team.
At the end of this course you will be building a full stack application and deploy it to present it infront of audience to show your skills that you gained throug the course. Speaking of audience; on the middle half of this course you will be doing with a group presentations for a specific topic on Thursdays. topics are specified by the instructional team. Have fun!!
