This level requires commitment, hard work and consistent effort to be successful.
If you ever get stuck on a problem for more than 20 minutes seek help from your TAs. Working with your classmates on an approach for a solution is allowed;however,submitting the same code is not. To avoid being removed from the course for plagiarism, always give credit by listing your sources and/or the colleagues you worked with while creating your solution. READING, READING, READING is key to success. Searching and understanding documentation is essential to maintaining your skills as a developer. You will find that the more you read and become familiar with the correct terms in the industry the easier it will be to communicate your thoughts and solutions to your team.
At the end of this course you will be building and deploying a full stack application and presenting it to an audience to show the skills that you gained throughout the course. Speaking of presentations; from the midpoint of this course you will be given the opportunity to practice group presentations for a specific topic on Thursdays.
